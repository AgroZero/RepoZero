# Angular - Ionic
[Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) is an open source mobile UI toolkit for building modern, high quality cross-platform mobile apps from a single code base in Angular and React. This document focuses on [Angular](https://angular.io/guide/what-is-angular) which is a TypeScript-based, free and open-source web application framework. 
>[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) adds additional syntax to JavaScript to support a **tighter integration with your editor**. TypeScript code converts to JavaScript, which **runs anywhere JavaScript runs**: In a browser, on Node.js and other things not in this document :) 
## Setting up the Environment 
**THIS SECTION IS STILL IN PROGRESS**
1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) 
> Download the LTS (Long Term Support) version as it's the most stable and is least likely to cause problems. 


## Using pre-created Environment 
A pre-created Environment should have a `package.json` file in it's root. This file contains the project dependencies, make sure it exists.
1.  Open a New Terminal in Visual Studio Code.
2. Add a command prompt terminal using the `+` icon on top right side of the terminal window.
3. Navigate to the project root using `cd ./example-root-folder/` 
4. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
5. Run `ionic build` to build the ionic framework.
6. Run `ionic serve` to run the project in your browser using localhost.

## Building Android App
**THIS SECTION IS STILL IN PROGRESS**
Make sure you have a working Environment.
